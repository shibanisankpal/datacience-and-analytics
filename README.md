## Prediction using Supervised ML

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● This is a simple linear regression as it involves just 2 variables. 

● Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data


## K-means clustering

● From the‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox


 ## Decision Tree Algorithm on Iris Dataset

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox



## Logistic Regression:

● Logistic Regression on digits dataset which is one of the datasets sklearn comes with.

● Confusion matrix is used to show the performance of the model by comparing test data with predictions.
